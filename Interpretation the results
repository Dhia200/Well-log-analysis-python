## Interpretation Summary

The analyzed interval shows zones characterized by:
- Low Gamma Ray and Vsh (<0.2), indicating clean lithology
- Elevated deep resistivity, suggesting potential hydrocarbon saturation
- Density porosity values around 15–20%, consistent with good reservoir quality

These observations indicate intervals with favorable petrophysical properties.
